# Predicting Post Graduate Salaires

The goal of this project is to see which factors influence a person's starting salary post-graduation. We use salary data and college data from the College Scorecard website.
Note: Due to Github's file size limit, I am unable to upload the colleges.csv file referenced in the data_processing.py file. You can download the csv file from https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/.

I preprocessed the data in Python and ran the analysis in R. 
To preprocess the data, use the following command (on Windows): py data_processing.py
